Inotify

The following interfaces can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by inotify:
/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events
    The value in this file is used when an application calls inotify_init(2) to set an upper limit on the number of events that can be queued to the corresponding inotify instance. Events in excess of this limit are dropped, but an IN_Q_OVERFLOW event is always generated. 
/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances
    This specifies an upper limit on the number of inotify instances that can be created per real user ID. 
/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
    This specifies an upper limit on the number of watches that can be created per real user ID.
